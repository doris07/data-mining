# Foundations and Applications of Data Mining

### Situation:
Trying to build 3 different types of recommendation systems, which using yelp dataset to predict the ratings/stars for given user ids and business ids.

### Tasks: 
My goal is building Item-Based CF recommendation system with Pearson similarity, Model-based, and Hybrid recommendation system. Additionaly, I would use the error distribution of computing the RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error) to evaluate your recommendation systems.

### Process:
To accomplish this goal, I embarked on a multifaceted approach. Firstly, for the Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendation system, I delved deep into the Yelp dataset, conducting extensive data preprocessing to ensure data quality. I then implemented the Pearson similarity algorithm, which involved rigorous testing and fine-tuning to optimize its performance. This step was particularly challenging as it required handling a large volume of user-item interactions effectively.

Next, I tackled the Model-Based recommendation system. Here, I employed advanced machine learning techniques, including matrix factorization and gradient descent, to build a predictive model. This model was designed to capture complex patterns within the data and make accurate recommendations based on user behavior.

In parallel, I worked on developing a Hybrid recommendation system that integrated the strengths of both the Item-Based CF and Model-Based approaches. This involved creating a framework that seamlessly combined the outputs of these two recommendation engines. I implemented user-specific weighting to ensure that the hybrid system delivered personalized recommendations.
